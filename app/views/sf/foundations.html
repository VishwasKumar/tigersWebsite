                    <p>As a foundation you want to ensure that the focus is on the root causes of social, economic and environmental injustices. And that is exactly where our efforts are focussed. The issues that we are dealing with have received scant attention. As a big foundation, you may find it difficult to reach out to small groups. So there is where we come in. We have the expertise to engage with these communities and with these issues. You can make us one of your partners, or support us in other ways. </p>
