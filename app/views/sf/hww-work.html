    <h3>Crisis Management Intervention by Sexual Minorities and Sex Workers – by Ms Veena</h3>
    <p>Veena, a volunteer of Solidarity Foundation conducted an action research on “How to manage crisis situations faced by members of Sexual Minorities and Sex Workers”. Her action research highlighted that crisis for sexual minorities starts first in their own families, who are bound by the traditions and customs prevalent in society. Children are brought up according to gendered societal norms. Behavioural changes are met with violence and exclusion. The family members beat up sexual minorities/transgenders from a very young age and throw them out of their homes. Facing such situations, usually the community members cut off their relationship with their own families. This leads to issues of migration and problems of mental health. Apart from gauging the condition of sexual minorities and sex workers who are in need of crisis intervention, the report also illustrated the requirements of the crisis intervention team.</p>
    <h3>Expanding Livelihood Options</h3>
    <p>On the 28th of March, 2013, we held a consultation on ‘Expanding Livelihood Options’ in United Theological College. Livelihood was deemed to be a crucial area of support that many community members voiced as important. Discussions with community members have underlined the need for systematic help to promote skills sets that allow for access to a wider range of livelihood, options, along with other interventions aimed at increasing self-confidence to pursue these options, linkages to resources, markets, information, credit etc. We invited organisations who have expertise and experience of working around these issues to this consultation. The consultation pointed out to the fact that for them to succeed in these new avenues of livelihood they need to be supported. They need help and support in terms of access to credit, increase in business skills, mentoring support etc.</p>
